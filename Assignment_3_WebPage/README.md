# Data Safety Basics Website

## Introduction

Hi, My name is Vu, and I am currently studying Information Technology - Networking and Cybersecurity. I've really enjoyed the learning process so far, and especially building my own webpage from scratch! Though I've ran into some difficulties, I am still proud of what I've managed to do with the page.

## Description

Using the base code provided for the assignment, I'm going to convert the report I've done for Assignment 2 into a functioning webpage. The web page will implement skills learnt from previous practicals and new ones. 

## Features

### Notable Features

- Dark mode toggling functionality.
- Buttons that displays images and their corresponding caption when clicked.
- Welcoming header that displays the user input.

### Niceties

- Matching color pallettes for both display modes.
- Nice borders!
- Cybersecurity basics

## Difficulties

I will rank features that I've had difficulty implementing, with 1 being the hardest.

1. **Persisten user preferences (local storage).**

I found this extremely challenging, I've tried multiple external resources in combination with the link provided in the assignment to no avail. Could not wrap my head around how to do this.

2. **Toggling between light and dark mode interchangably.**

The most challenging part of this was learning how different commands worked and implementing if and else statements.

3. **Name query**

This I found to be somewhat difficult but after some research, I was able to get my codes to work.
